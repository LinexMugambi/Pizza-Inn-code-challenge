# PIZZA-INN

## Project Description
This project is to implement associations of an API for tracking pizza establishments in a "small" Rails application.

### Features
You will have the following options as an application user:

Build a backend for a Rails API.
have three resources or more (three DB tables).
Requirements
You must: for this project.

- Active Record can be used to communicate with a database.
- Have a one-to-many link between at least two models.
- Create the following API routes in Sinatra at the very least:
- action creation and reading for both models
- fully functional CRUD for one of the models.
- Create a separate React frontend app that communicates with the API to carry out CRUD operations.
- Use effective OO design patterns. Each of your models should have its own class, which you should build where necessary, instance and class methods.
- Installation Backend Configuration
- This repository contains all the startup code required to launch a Sinatra backend. To begin, fork and clone this repository. Run bundle install after that to put the gems in.

Before cloning the repository, make sure to fork a copy into your GitHub account. You can accomplish this by clicking the aforementioned link, the "Octocat" button at the top of this page, and then "Fork" in the repo page's upper right corner.

An example GET route handler may be found in the file app/controllers/application controller.rb. With the routes for your project, replace this route.

Your server can be started using:

       $ Rails s
With this, your server willport number 3000 on a local machine.

Frontend Configuration
You ought to have two separate repositories for your frontend and your backend.

A React app for your frontend should be created in a new repository in a separate folder. Cd out of the backend project directory and run create-react-app to produce the required code for your React frontend to achieve this:

<b>Create-React-App</b>: 

      $ npx my-app-frontend
If you're working with a partner, you should make a repository on GitHub after starting the project locally so that you can host it there and facilitate collaboration.

create-react-app is one of the tools and technology used.
